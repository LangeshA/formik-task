This repo contains of  library management system that allows users to manage book and author details using Formik for all form validations.


Formik is a small group of React components and hooks for building forms in React and React Native. It helps with the three most annoying parts:

Getting values in and out of form state
Validation and error messages
Handling form submission
By colocating all of the above in one place, Formik keeps things organized--making testing, refactoring, and reasoning about your forms a breeze.
